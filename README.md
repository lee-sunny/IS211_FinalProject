Project Option 2: Blog Application

My blog web application allows users to create blog posts.
The "Home (My Blog)" link at the top left provides access to all posts from all users. Therefore, any users can read the blog posts without loggin in.

To publish new posts or to update and delete existing posts, users must register and login (links at top right).
Users are required to enter unique usernames and emails as well as password twice in order to be validated into the database.
The passwords are hashed for security.
Once registered, user can login and is redirected to their own dashboard where they can see a list of their own posts.
Once logged in, the navigation in top right is changed so that user can easily go to their own Dashboard, create new post, or logout.

In the dashboard, user can click on existing post titles which are linked so that they can update or delete the post.
All posts are displayed in reverse chronological order (whether in Home or Dashboard view).
Each post is required to have a title and content. The time is stamped authomatically.

EXTRA CREDIT:
The application supports multiple users. As long as the username and email is unique. The user, once logged in, can also update their information in "Account" link in top right. This updated information replaces their previous credentials.

EXTRA CREDIT:
Perma-links: A unique URL is created for each blog post. Whether on the Home page or the Dashboard page, each blog post title is linked to its own perma-link. Also each username is linked to the user's own dashboard.
